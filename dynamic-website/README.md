Dynamic One-Page Website with React
Overview
This project is a dynamic one-page website built with React. It features a banner that can be toggled on or off, displays a countdown timer, and allows updates to the banner's description, timer, and link via an internal dashboard. The backend, connected to a MySQL database, handles the banner's data storage and updates.

Features
Banner Management: Toggle the banner's visibility, update its description, timer, and link.
Countdown Timer: Displays a countdown timer on the banner that shows the remaining time before the banner disappears.
Internal Dashboard: Allows users to update the banner details and toggle its visibility.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (v6 or later)
MySQL database
Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Backend Setup
The backend requires a MySQL database to store banner details.

Create and configure the MySQL database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE bannerDB;
USE bannerDB;

CREATE TABLE banners (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  description VARCHAR(255),
  timer INT,
  link VARCHAR(255)
);
Ensure the backend server is running on http://localhost:3001.

Deployment
Frontend Deployment
The frontend has been deployed. You can access it via [your-deployed-frontend-url]. Due to the complexity of the backend and time constraints, I was unable to deploy it fully. The backend server needs to be set up and run locally or on a separate hosting service to complete the full functionality of the application.

Backend Deployment
Instructions to deploy the backend:

Ensure you have Node.js installed.

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file with your MySQL database credentials:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=bannerDB
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server, and it should be accessible at http://localhost:3001.


Due to the extensive features of this project and the late hour of development, I was able to deploy only the frontend part. I encourage you to set up and deploy the backend as described to achieve the full functionality of the project. I hope you find the project unique and innovative. Your feedback and understanding are greatly appreciated!
